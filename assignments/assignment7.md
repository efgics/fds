## Understanding

### Make sure your repo is up-to-date

Assignment code is pushed weekly during the semester, so please pull from this repo first and copy the A7 folder to your repo.

The purpose of this assignment is to gauge your understanding of the concepts taught during the first half of the course. No coding is required, but good conceptual knowledge is. Feel free to reach out to your instructor and TA for help if you have questions.

### Do not forget to push your local changes to the Github server.

## Grading Policy
 - Answer the questions in A7 Questions.docx. This document should be saved as A7.pdf and placed in your A7 folder on GitHub.
